## How to begin Part 1:


To begin, go to https://colab.research.google.com/ 

Use of Colab is free. Note - There are limitations on the free version, but we will not reach these for our conversion purposes. 

On the Colab example home page, select "File", then "Open Notebook"

There is a Tab for "Github"; select that tab and paste 
```
https://github.com/BioinformaticaUSFQ1/Course_Bioinformatics
```
into the search bar under "Enter a GitHub URL or search by organization or user" 

After a brief search, you will see
```
Modules/Module_1_Notebook_Part1and2_v1.ipynb
```
below "Path". Click on "Module_1_Notebook_Part1and2_v2.ipynb"

In order to run the cells, you will need to login with your Google account (it is free to make an account).

**NB - The one opened directly from git will not save unless the first notebook steps are followed!**
