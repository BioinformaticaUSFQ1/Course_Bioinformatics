## How to begin:
Due to colab errors, use notebook 
Modules/Fixed_module3_final.ipynb

To begin, go to https://colab.research.google.com/ 

Use of Colab is free. Note - There are limitations on the free version, but we will not reach these for our conversion purposes. 

On the Colab example home page, select "File", then "Open Notebook"

There is a Tab for "Github"; select that tab and paste 
```
https://github.com/BioinformaticaUSFQ1/Course_Bioinformatics
```
into the search bar under "Enter a GitHub URL or search by organization or user" 

After a brief search, you will see
```
Modules/Module_3_Part1_Sequencing_Run_QC_(Nanopore_and_Illumina).ipynb
```
```
Modules/Module_3_Part2_Nanopore_SARS_CoV_2_genome_reconstruction.ipynb
```
```
Modules/Module_3_Part3_SARS_CoV_2.ipynb
```
below "Path". Click on "Module_3...."

In order to run the cells, you will need to login with your Google account (it is free to make an account).

**NB - Part 3 is for homework!**

**NB - The one opened directly from git will not save unless the first notebook steps are followed!**
